Prerequisites:
   
   scons : for building. Recent linux distributions usually provide it. If it is not available,
      a selfcontained version is bundled. Last resort: http://www.scons.org/
   
   spglib: only for symmetry in k-space TB. If not available in the system repositories see:
         http://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=spglib&project=home:pashov_d 
         http://spglib.sourceforge.net/
      It can be disabled by adding '-D NOSYM' to the 'fflags' field in flags.makefile 
   
   mpi : only used in the parallel executable. openmpi, mpich2, and intel's mpi have been tested.

   
Compilation:
   
   1. Create a flags.makefile file in a preferably empty folder designated for building. Examples are provided for gfortran and ifort. 
      If an mpi library is not available comment out the field 'mpifc' or leave it empty.
      
   2. To build everything issue 'scons -Y /path/to/pb'. Execute 'alias scons=/path/to/scons' before this if the budled version is used.
      To build significantly faster on multicore/thread system append -j "number of compilation processes".
      To build only certain files specify them explicitly on the command line.
      
Example:
   Assumig openmpi and recent gfortran are available a simple setup may be:
   
      tar -xvf pb.tbz2
      cd pb/
      bpth=$(pwd)
      mkdir -p bld/g/o
      cd bld/g/o
      ln -fs ${bpth}/flags.gfortran.opt.makefile flags.makefile
      ${bpth}/scons-2.2.0/scons -Y $bpth -j 32
   
   There are two examples of input files of dislocation and nudged elastic band relaxations in the folder 'fe'.
